# Math formulas
**_This project is designed to describe basic mathematical formulas_**
## Area
- Circle: S = πR²
> EX: R = 2, π = 3.14 => S = 12.56
- Rectangle: S = ab
> EX: a = 3, b = 4 => S = 12
- Square: S = a²
> EX: a = 9 => S = 81
- Triangle: S = ah/2
> EX: a = 3, h = 4 => S = 6
## Perimeter
- Circle: P = 2πR
> EX: R = 4, π = 3.14 => P = 25.12
- Rectangle: P = 2a + 2b
> EX:   a = 2, b = 1 => P = 6
- Square: P = 4a
> EX: a = 8 => P = 32
- Triangle: P = 2(a + b)
> EX: a = 5, b = 10 => P = 30
